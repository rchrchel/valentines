Happy Valentineâ€™s Day. I know we are no longer together, and maybe this letter will seem out of place, but I couldnâ€™t let today pass without telling you how much you still mean to me. you have always been, and always will be, someone incredibly special in my life.<br><br>
loving you was one of the most beautiful things that ever happened to me. every moment we shared, every laugh, every deep conversation, and even the silences in between... I cherish them all. you were my greatest love, and no amount of time or distance will ever change that.<br><br>
I still think about you, about us, about the way you made my world brighter just by existing in it. there are so many things I wish I could say, so many things I wish I could relive, but most of all, I just want you to know that I will always carry you in my heart.<br><br>
even though our paths have diverged, my love for you has not faded. it has simply transformed into something softer, i will always wish you happiness. you deserve the world, and I hope that wherever life takes you, you find the love, peace, and joy that you once gave me.<br><br>
no matter what happens, you were my greatest love story, and I will always be grateful for the time we had together.<br><br>
with all my love,<br>
Rachel Anastasya`;
